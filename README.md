# Helm Examples

This repo contains basic helm charts that can be used to create resources in an Openshift cluster. To install these charts you will need to have [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your machine.

See the [README](https://github.com/workload-assessment-openshift4/helm-examples/blob/main/helloworld-chart/README.md) in helloworld-chart for more information.
